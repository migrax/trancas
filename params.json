One file describes the network topology, while the second one control the behavior of the agents and the traffic matrix.\r\n\r\nInvocation\r\n----------\r\n\r\n`trancas prefix`\r\n\r\nWhere `prefix` is the filename prefix common to the two configuration files.\r\n\r\nOutput\r\n------\r\n\r\nThe output of the simulator is controlled by the configuration file. The simulator can print the current routes for the traffic, and he associated energy demands.\r\n\r\nLegal\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCopyright © Miguel Rodríguez Pérez <miguel@det.uvigo.es> 2011—2014\r\n\r\nThis simulator is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPL-3.0).
