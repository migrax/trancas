# Configuration
The configuration is stores in plain text files. Lines starting with # are
simply discarded.

The are three configuration files:

* <prefix>.topo: Stores the configuration
* <prefix>.traffic: Holds the time-dependant traffic matrix

# Topology file
Each line in this file represents a link between two nodes. Node names are
arbitrary text strings and are dinamycally declared. In each line, both nodes
must be separated by an arbitrary name of blank characters.

Then, each line can has a parameter for describing the maximum desired rate
carried by the link (0 for no limit) and finally a vector describing the power
characteristics of each link, according to the formula:
P(lambda) = a_0 * log(lambda) + b + sum_i=1^n a_i P(lambda)

# Traffic file
Each line contains an order with the following format.
[ Traffic_variation | Information display | Seed initialization | Ant]

where

Traffic_variation := [A|R] node_orig node_dst traffic

and A means "add traffic /traffic/ between node_orig and node_dst" and
R means "remove traffic /traffic/ between node_orig and node_dst".

Information display := C [node_orig node_dst]

shows the current cost of the whole network (default) or, alternatively, the
path between node_orig and node_dst.

Seed initialization := S seed

Ant := A number [v]

and v is the verbosity level, that caused the simulator to signal changes in the routes.
